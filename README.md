# Mars Cash

MARS Cash = cMARS
MARS Shares = sMARS
MARS Bonds = bMARS

BANK
1. Genesis period to print cMARS (or doggyDollars, MARS Dollars, MARS Cash, whatever we call it)
Stables + renDoge + mirroredTesla . What is the best strat here? More towards renDoge? 
Lets say 100k MARS Cash is printed (supposed to be $1) evenly across all pools for a period of 5 days. 

2. sMARS (Mars Shares), distribution starts shortly after the bonus BANK period 
cMARS-USDT SLP? or cMARS-DAI SLP? Lets try to be on sushiswap so can possibly try to get onsen pools or incentivization there eventually. 
distribute 75% of total sMARS to this pair over a year
sMARS-USDT SLP? or sMARS-DAI SLP? 
distribute 25% of total sMARS to this pair over a year

Strat question: do we want to have any type of renDoge pairs to start? 

Tokenomics for sMARS: 1mil total? 100k total? 

The rest of the monetary policy is exactly the same as Basis or MITH.
